///
/// ## Using `Registry` as the basis of an exporter
///
/// As a reusable building blocking for building exporter implementations, users should look at
/// [`Key`] and [`AtomicStorage`][crate::registry::AtomicStorage] to use for their key and storage,
/// respectively.
///
/// These two implementations provide behavior that is suitable for most exporters, providing
/// seamless integration with the existing key type used by the core
/// [`Recorder`][metrics::Recorder] trait, as well as atomic storage for metrics.
///
/// In some cases, users may prefer
/// [`GenerationalAtomicStorage`][crate::registry::GenerationalAtomicStorage] when know if a metric
/// has been touched, even if its value has not changed since the last time it was observed, is
/// necessary.
///
/// ## Performance
///
