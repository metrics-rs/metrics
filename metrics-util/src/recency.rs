//! Metric recency.
//!
//! Recency deals with the concept of removing metrics that have not been updated for a certain
//! amount of time.  In some use cases, metrics are tied to specific labels which are short-lived,
//! such as labels referencing a date or a version of software.  When these labels change, exporters
//! may still be emitting those older metrics which are no longer relevant.  In many cases, a
//! long-lived application could continue tracking metrics such that the unique number of metrics
//! grows until a significant portion of memory is required to track them all, even if the majority
//! of them are no longer used.
//!
//! This module contains the building blocks to both track recency and act on it.
//!
//! ## `Generation`, `Generational<T>`, and `GenerationalPrimitives`
//!
//! These three types form the basis of wrapping metrics so that they can be tracked with a
//! generation counter.  This counter is incremented every time a mutating operation is performed.
//! In tracking the generation of a metric, it can be determined whether or not a metric has changed
//! between two observations, even if the value of the metric is identical between the two
//! observations.
//!
//! ## `Recency`
//!
//! This type provides the tracking of metrics, and their generations, so that exporters can quickly
//! determine if a metric that has just been observed has been "idle" for a given amount of time or
//! longer.  This provides the final piece that allows exporters to remove metrics which are no
//! longer relevant to the application.
