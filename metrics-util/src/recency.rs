/// Tracks recency of metric updates by their registry generation and time.

/// In many cases, a user may have a long-running process where metrics are stored over time using
/// labels that change for some particular reason, leaving behind versions of that metric with
/// labels that are no longer relevant to the current process state.  This can lead to cases where
/// metrics that no longer matter are still present in rendered output, adding bloat.
///
/// When coupled with [`Registry`](crate::Registry), [`Recency`] can be used to track when the last
/// update to a metric has occurred for the purposes of removing idle metrics from the registry.  In
/// addition, it will remove the value from the registry itself to reduce the aforementioned bloat.
///
/// [`Recency`] is separate from [`Registry`](crate::Registry) specifically to avoid imposing any
/// slowdowns when tracking recency does not matter, despite their otherwise tight coupling.
