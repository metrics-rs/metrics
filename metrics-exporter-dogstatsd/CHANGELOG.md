## [0.9.0] - 2025-01-19

### Added

- Genesis of the new version of this crate. This version of the exporter is a successor to the original
  `metrics-exporter-dogstatsd` exporter written by [Valentino Volonghi](https://github.com/dialtone), and starts after
  the last version of that crate (`0.8.0`) to indicate the SemVer-incompatible changes that have been made. This new
  crate is MIT licenses just as the original one was. The old code can be found
  [here](https://github.com/dialtone/metrics-exporter-dogstatsd).
