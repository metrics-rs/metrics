//! Use [`tracing::span!`] fields as [`metrics`] labels.
//!
//! The `metrics-tracing-context` crate provides tools to enable injecting the
//! contextual data maintained via `span!` macro from the [`tracing`] crate
//! into the metrics.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! First, set up `tracing` and `metrics` crates:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use metrics_util::debugging::DebuggingRecorder;
//! # use tracing_subscriber::Registry;
//! use metrics_tracing_context::{MetricsLayer, TracingContextLayer};
//! use metrics_util::layers::Layer;
//! use tracing_subscriber::layer::SubscriberExt;
//!
//! // Prepare tracing.
//! # let my_subscriber = Registry::default();
//! let subscriber = my_subscriber.with(MetricsLayer::new());
//! tracing::subscriber::set_global_default(subscriber).unwrap();
//!
//! // Prepare metrics.
//! # let my_recorder = DebuggingRecorder::new();
//! let recorder = TracingContextLayer::all().layer(my_recorder);
//! metrics::set_global_recorder(recorder).unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! Then emit some metrics within spans and see the labels being injected!
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use metrics_util::{debugging::DebuggingRecorder, layers::Layer};
//! # use tracing_subscriber::{layer::SubscriberExt, Registry};
//! # use metrics_tracing_context::{MetricsLayer, TracingContextLayer};
//! # let mysubscriber = Registry::default();
//! # let subscriber = mysubscriber.with(MetricsLayer::new());
//! # tracing::subscriber::set_global_default(subscriber).unwrap();
//! # let myrecorder = DebuggingRecorder::new();
//! # let recorder = TracingContextLayer::all().layer(myrecorder);
//! # metrics::set_global_recorder(recorder).unwrap();
//! use tracing::{span, Level};
//! use metrics::counter;
//!
//! let user = "ferris";
//! let span = span!(Level::TRACE, "login", user);
//! let _guard = span.enter();
//!
//! counter!("login_attempts", "service" => "login_service").increment(1);
//! ```
//!
//! The code above will emit a increment for a `login_attempts` counter with
//! the following labels:
//! - `service=login_service`
//! - `user=ferris`
//!
//! # Implementation
//!
//! The integration layer works by capturing all fields that are present when a span is created,
//! as well as fields recorded after the fact, and storing them as an extension to the span. If
//! a metric is emitted while a span is entered, any fields captured for that span will be added
//! to the metric as additional labels.
//!
//! Be aware that we recursively capture the fields of a span, including fields from
//! parent spans, and use them when generating metric labels. This means that if a metric is being
//! emitted in span B, which is a child of span A, and span A has field X, and span B has field Y,
//! then the metric labels will include both field X and Y. This applies regardless of how many
//! nested spans are currently entered.
//!
//! ## Duplicate span fields
//!
//! When span fields are captured, they are deduplicated such that only the most recent value is kept.
//! For merging parent span fields into the current span fields, the fields from the current span have
//! the highest priority. Additionally, when using [`Span::record`][tracing::Span::record] to add fields
//! to a span after it has been created, the same behavior applies. This means that recording a field
//! multiple times only keeps the most recently recorded value, including if a field was already present
//! from a parent span and is then recorded dynamically in the current span.
//!
//! ## Span fields and ancestry
//!
//! Likewise, we capture the sum of all fields for a span and its parent span(s), meaning that if you have the
//! following span stack:
//!
//! ```text
//! root span        (fieldA => valueA)
//!  ⤷ mid-tier span (fieldB => valueB)
//!     ⤷ leaf span  (fieldC => valueC)
//! ```
//!
//! Then a metric emitted while within the leaf span would get, as labels, all three fields: A, B,
//! and C.  As well, this layer does _not_ deduplicate the fields.  If you have two instance of the
//! same field name, both versions will be included in your metric labels.  Whether or not those are
//! deduplicated, and how they're deduplicated, is an exporter-specific implementation detail.
//!
//! In addition, for performance purposes, span fields are held in pooled storage, and additionally
//! will copy the fields of parent spans.  Following the example span stack from above, the mid-tier
//! span would hold both field A and B, while the leaf span would hold fields A, B, and C.
//!
//! In practice, these extra memory consumption used by these techniques should not matter for
//! modern systems, but may represent an unacceptable amount of memory usage on constrained systems
//! such as embedded platforms, etc.
